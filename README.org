Reading List for CSIRT Team Members

The goal of this list is to develop a prioritized list of essential
reading for network defenders. While other github repos (/Awesome/ links
below) contain comprehensive lists of references and tools, this list
aims to provide a starting point of the top documents defenders need to
have a firm operational foundation.

** Essential References:
- Hardening Guides:

  Although IT Operations are responsible for implementation of systems
  and hardening guides, defenders should be deeply aware of available
  controls. Hardening guides should not be considered only as profiles
  to audit against, but as tools for defense and monitoring. Are you
  monitoring existing controls for compliance and violation? Or
  selecting additional controls that can provide useful data for
  threat-hunting?

  standards based vulnerability management data represented using the Security

  databases of security checklists, security related software flaws,
  misconfigurations, product names, and impact metrics.

- [[https://www.threatconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/ThreatConnect-The-Diamond-Model-of-Intrusion-Analysis.pdf][The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis]] This paper presents a novel model of
  intrusion analysis built by analysts, derived from years of experience, asking
  the simple question, "What is the underlying method to our work?" The model
  establishes the basic atomic element of any intrusion activity, the event,
  composed of four core features: adversary, infrastructure, capability, and
  victim. These features are edge-connected representing their underlying
  relationships and arranged in the shape of a diamond, giving the model its
  name: the Diamond Model. It further defines additional meta-features to
  support higher-level constructs such as linking events together into activity
  threads and further coalescing events and threads into activity groups. These
  elements, the event, thread, and group all contribute to a foundational and
  comprehensive model of intrusion activity built around analytic processes. It
  captures the essential concepts of intrusion analysis and adversary operations
  while allowing the model flexibility to expand and encompass new ideas and
  concepts. The model establishes, for the first time, a formal method applying
  scientific principles to intrusion analysis -- particularly those of
  measurement, testability, and repeatability -- providing a comprehensive
  method of activity documentation, synthesis, and correlation. This scientific
  approach and simplicity produces improvements in analytic effectiveness,
  efficiency, and accuracy. Ultimately, the model provides opportunities to
  integrate intelligence in real-time for network defense, automating
  correlation across events, classifying events with confidence into adversary
  campaigns, and forecasting adversary operations while planning and gaming
  mitigation strategies.

- [[https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/forensics/analysis-meterpreter-post-exploitation-35537][An Analysis of Meterpreter during Post-Exploitation]] Abstract: Much has
  been written about using the Metasploit Framework, but what has
  received minimal attention is an analysis of how it accomplishes what
  it does. This paper provides an analysis of the post-exploitation
  activity of a Meterpreter shell on a compromised Windows 7 system.
  Areas looked at include the characteristics of the stager and payload,
  fingerprinting the HTTP C2 and beaconing traffic, finding Meterpreter
  in memory, and several post-exploitation modules that could be used.
  By focusing on what occurs instead of how to accomplish it, defenders
  are better equipped to detect and respond.

- [[https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/dns/detecting-dns-tunneling-34152][Detecting DNS Tunneling]] Abstract: DNS is a foundational protocol which enables
  applications such as web browsers to function based on domain names.  DNS is
  not intended for a command channel or general purpose tunneling. However,
  several utilities have been developed to enable tunneling over DNS. Because it
  is not intended for general data transfer, DNS often has less attention in
  terms of security monitoring than other protocols such as web traffic. If DNS
  tunneling goes undetected, it represents a significant risk to an
  organization. This paper reviews DNS tunneling utilities and discusses
  practical techniques for detecting DNS tunneling. Two categories of detection
  considered are payload analysis and traffic analysis. The payload detection
  techniques have been used to detect successfully specific DNS tunneling
  utilities. The traffic analysis based technique can be used to universally
  detect DNS tunneling. With these detection techniques implemented
  organizations can reduce the risk associated with DNS tunneling.
